# Computer-Science-IA
This is a school project, and the premise of the project is to provide a solution to a problem a client is having. The client can be anyone and they will provide a problem they are facing and the goal is to use computer science to solve said problem. My client for this project is my father and since he owns a restaurant, a common problem that occurs is customers calling for information and to place orders. This is a problem because the servers of the restaurant also serve as the phone operators, which often leads to them sometimes having to drop what they are doing and answer the telephone. The planned solution to this problem is to update their pre existing website, and allow customers to place orders, write complaints and put down reservations without having to phone the restuarant. Thus hopefully reducing call volume and letting the restaurant run more efficiently.
